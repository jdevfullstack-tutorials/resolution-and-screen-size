# Resolution And Screen Size
Resolution is the one that you always
hear, just like "oh nice, the video is 1080p",
"this camera is 1080p".

But when you consider 1080p and a display,
just like a computer monitor,
there is a relationship between the
two.

1080p will not always be good if the
screen monitor is large enough, say,
32". That will be truly pixelated
for normal viewing distance for
a computer monitor.

## Resolution
Resolution is the clarity of an image
displayed on a screen. They always
say that the higher the resolution,
the better. But this should be in
the context of the size of the screen.

Resolution is always expressed as a 
fixed number of pixels horizontally and
vertically. So, 1920x1080 resolution
means, 1920 pixels arranged horizontally
and 1080 pixels vertically.

As was mentioned, this will not 
always be good if the screen is large 
enough. This will be truly pixelated
for normal viewing distance for
a computer monitor.

### Pixel Per Inch
Pixel Per Inch is the result when you
compute the resolution against
the size of the screen. This will also 
determine whether a certain display
is retina or not.

But don't you know that distance will
really matter also? Even 1080p
can be retina when far enough!
