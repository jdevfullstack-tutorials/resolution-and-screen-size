# Resolution And Screen Size
Resolution is the one that you always
hear, just like "oh nice, the video is 1080p",
"this camera is 1080p".

But when you consider 1080p and a display,
just like a computer monitor,
there is a relationship between the
two.

## Resolution
Resolution is the clarity of an image
on a given monitor.

It is measured as the density of pixels
on any given area. 
### Pixel Per Inch
Pixel Per Inch is the result when you
compute the resolution against
the size of the screen. This will 
determine also whether a certain display
is retina or not.
