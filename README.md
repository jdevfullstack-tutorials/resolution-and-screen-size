# Resolution And Screen Size
Resolution is the one that you always
hear, just like "oh nice, the video is 1080p",
"this camera is 1080p".

But when you consider 1080p and a display,
just like a computer monitor,
there is a relationship between the
two.

1080p will not always be good if the
screen monitor is large enough, say,
32". That will be truly pixelated
for normal viewing distance for
a computer monitor.

## Resolution
Resolution is the clarity of an image
displayed on a screen. They always
say that the higher the resolution,
the better. But this should be in
the context of the size of the screen.

Resolution is always expressed as a 
fixed number of pixels horizontally and
vertically. So, 1920x1080 resolution
means, 1920 pixels arranged horizontally
and 1080 pixels vertically.

As was mentioned, this will not 
always be good if the screen is large 
enough. This will be truly pixelated
for normal viewing distance for
a computer monitor.

### Pixel Per Inch
Pixel Per Inch is the result when you
compute the resolution against
the size of the screen. This will also 
determine whether a certain display
is retina or not.

But don't you know that distance will
really matter also? Even 1080p
can be retina when far enough!

### About Retina
The `Retina Display` term was popularized by
Apple. Yet, high-end Android phones back then
were naturally retina for a good quality 
because, of course,
smartphones tend to be viewed at close range.

For large monitors, this is really for 
productivity. Mac emphasized it for
productivity. The downside is that it's
not good for highly-demanding games, where
speed is the most important one.

Retina displays are pixel-densed
when you measure the PPI. Of course, the
more pixels, the more demanding it
is for the processor or the graphics card.

## Resolution Of The Monitor
Whether the computer supports the resolution
of the monitor or not, it is the resolution
of the display that tells the maximum
resolution.

For example, you bought 24" 1080p and
you think that, for example, your
MacBook Air can project 4k or higher
on that external monitor. Although
MacBook Air supports higher resolution,
it will still project 1080p because
that's the limit of the monitor you
bought.

## Display Scaling
Display scaling is another important one
when you measure the overall quality of
your display. Windows tends to be left behind
when it comes to display scaling. It
cannot make all the GUI components proportional
to one another. For example, on a 1080p
Windows 10 OS, 125% is the recommended scaling,
yet, I cannot satisfy myself looking at the very
large `Close` button of this Chrome, for example.

Yet one the iMac issued by my company, no matter
whether you adjust the scaling up or down,
you still get the proportion.

Take note, this is always being misinterpreted
that when you scale up a certain resolution,
it will make the resolution lower. No, it is not.
It only makes things bigger on your screen.

## Overall Quality
As for productivity, I'm into Mac, all Mac,
even MacBook Air can be projected to two
4k monitors. iMac is perfect. 

For gaming, nothing can replace Windows.

This is actually being demonstrated by Joma Tech,

where, there is the Windows setup that later on
he showed being used for gaming, and his productivity,
the Mac with the two big ass monitors.
